# Welcome to my blog

This is a note for myself about some leadership styles that I should follow for further improvement as a Software Engineer.

-------------------------------------

## Transactional Leadership

Leader-member exchange (LMX) theory was initially introduced as Vertical Dyad Linkage theory which concentrates on establishing dynamic the interaction between leaders and subordinates. In contrast with traditional leadership approaches believing that leaders need to adopt a single leadership style with all of their followers in the organization, LMX theory only focuses on developing a strong relationship with followers who can contribute to the growth of the organization. In other words, leaders classify their subordinates into two groups, in-group and out-group, according to performance, motivation, and trust. Then, the members of these two groups are treated differently. While members in the in-group receive more career opportunities, resources, supports, and guidance; the out-group members have to do fewer challenging tasks with little supports and resources. As a result, trustworthy and high-performance members feel that they are honored and valuables so that they will devote more to the organization in the return. 

## Transformation Leadership
Transformational leadership, which was adopted in 1985 by Bernard Bass, emphasized the creativity and innovative of employees. Transformational leaders give followers the motivation, inspiration, and authority to make their own decisions in the assigned tasks. This leadership approach not only develops higher innovation and creativity but also gains more trust and satisfaction from subordinates. Transformational leadership comprises of four core values:
-	Individualized Consideration: Leaders take the responsibility of supporting and coaching their followers in need by listening to their idea and frequent communication.
-	Intellectual Stimulation: Leaders foster creativity and innovative inside each of their followers by giving them challenges and encouraging them to solve the challenges by their approaches.
-	Inspirational Motivation: Leaders set a clear and appealing vision. Then leaders persuade their followers about the optimism of future goals and provide a strong sense of purpose. The power of “Why” drives their followers to invest more effort in accomplishing the goal.
-	Idealized Influence: Leaders are the role models for their subordinates.


## Empowering Leadership
Empowering leadership, which was recently researched by Kirkman and Rosen in 1999 [10], refers to “delegating authority to employees, promoting their self-directed and autonomous decision making, coaching, sharing information and asking for input” [19]. Even though empowering leadership is similar to transformational leadership in some aspects, the purpose is quite different. Empowering leaders give the opportunities for employees to develop the competencies they wanted while transformational leadership requires employees to possess a set of skills benefiting toward the vision and overall objectives [20]. Empowering leadership is necessary for the situation that a company’s goals and objectives are not the major concerns of employees, but they can still devote their time and effort for the company for their self-development.
